## Abstract

Breast cancer incidence and mortality rise sharply with age, but the role of **aberrant alternative splicing (AS)** in elderly patients remains poorly defined. Using **TCGA and FUSCC cohorts**, we identified a significantly higher frequency of abnormal AS events in elderly breast cancer compared to younger patients, including **390 high-variability-specific (HVS) events**.

Unsupervised clustering based on these events revealed **three subtypes** with distinct **immune infiltration patterns, genomic instability, and prognoses**. Further, we identified **68 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)** as potential regulators of these splicing profiles. A **machine learning model (SelectKBest-SVM)** was constructed using these RBPs, achieving high predictive accuracy for elderly patient outcomes across independent cohorts.

## Key Points

- Elderly breast cancer patients show more frequent **aberrant AS events**.
- **390 HVS splicing events** define three subtypes with distinct prognosis.
- **Cluster 3 subtype**: poor prognosis, immune exhaustion, high genomic instability.
- **68 RBPs** identified as potential splicing regulators.
- **Predictive SVM model** validated across TCGA, METABRIC, and GEO cohorts.
- **Drug sensitivity prediction** points to targeted therapies for poor-outcome subtypes.
